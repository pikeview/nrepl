  "Server configuration utilities.
  Some server options can be configured via configuration
  files (local or global).  This namespace provides
  convenient API to work with them.

  The config resolution algorithm is the following:
  The global config file .nrepl/config.edn is merged with
  any local config file (.nrepl-config.edn) if present.
  The values in the local config file take precedence."
