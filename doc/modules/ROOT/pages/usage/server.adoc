= nREPL Server

== Starting a server

There are many ways to start an nREPL server. Most often you'd start
it using some build tool, but you can also embed the server in your
application and start it from it. Here we'll outline the most
popular options available for you today.

=== Using Clojure CLI tools

NOTE: This section assumes you're using Clojure 1.9+ and nREPL 0.4.4+.

If you're into the `clj` command you can take advantage of nREPL's built-in command-line interface
(`nrepl.cmdline`).

Add this alias to `~/.clojure/deps.edn`:

[source,clojure]
----
{
;; ...
:aliases {:nREPL
          {:extra-deps
            {nrepl/nrepl {:mvn/version "0.4.5"}}}}
}
----

Then you can simply run the nREPL server in headless mode like this:

[source,shell]
----
$ clj -R:nREPL -m nrepl.cmdline
----

A good practice is add whatever nREPL middleware you want to use to
the `nREPL` profile, so you can easily activate them when needed. Here's
how you can easily start a ClojureScript capable nREPL:

[source,clojure]
----
{
;; ...
:aliases {:nREPL
          {:extra-deps
           {nrepl/nrepl {:mvn/version "0.4.5"}
            cider/piggieback {:mvn/version "0.3.8"}}}}
}
----

[source,shell]
----
$ clj -R:nREPL -m nrepl.cmdline --middleware "[cider.piggieback/wrap-cljs-repl]"
----

Here's a listing of all the options available via nREPL's command-line
interface (this output was simply generated with `--help`):

....
-i/--interactive            Start nREPL and connect to it with the built-in client.
-c/--connect                Connect to a running nREPL with the built-in client.
-C/--color                  Use colors to differentiate values from output in the REPL. Must be combined with --interactive.
-b/--bind ADDR              Bind address, by default "127.0.0.1".
-h/--host ADDR              Host address to connect to when using --connect. Defaults to "localhost".
-p/--port PORT              Start nREPL on PORT. Defaults to 0 (random port) if not specified.
--ack ACK-PORT              Acknowledge the port of this server to another nREPL server running on ACK-PORT.
-n/--handler HANDLER        The nREPL message handler to use for each incoming connection; defaults to the result of `(nrepl.server/default-handler)`.
-m/--middleware MIDDLEWARE  A sequence of vars, representing middleware you wish to mix in to the nREPL handler.
-t/--transport TRANSPORT    The transport to use. By default that's `nrepl.transport/bencode`.
--help                      Show this help message.
....

=== Using Leiningen

link:https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen[Leiningen] has built-in support for nREPL since
version 2. Just do:

[source,shell]
----
$ lein repl
----

And you're all set. By default Lein will also connect to the running nREPL server using the
popular command-line nREPL client link:https://github.com/trptcolin/reply/[REPL-y]. If you don't need the terminal REPL you can
also start nREPL in headless mode:

[source,shell]
----
$ lein repl :headless
----

=== Using Boot

link:https://github.com/boot-clj/boot[Boot] is a popular alternative to Leiningen, that also has build-in support for nREPL:

[source,shell]
----
$ boot repl
----

== Embedding nREPL

All the above options are typically used during the development of an application.
It can also be extremely useful to have your application host a REPL
server whereever it might be deployed; this can greatly simplify debugging,
sanity-checking, panicked code patching, and so on.

WARNING: You should think long and hard before hot-patching code in
production, but that's a subject for an unrelated discussion.

nREPL provides a socket-based server that you can trivially start from your
application.  <<installation.adoc#,Add it to your project's dependencies>>, and add code
like this to your app:

[source,clojure]
----
=> (require '[nrepl.server :refer [start-server stop-server]])
nil
=> (defonce server (start-server :port 7888))
='user/server
----

If you want your nREPL server to listen on a particular address instead of the
default one, you can use the `:bind` keyword to specify the address to
listen on. E.g., to make the nREPL server listen on address 172.18.0.5
and port 4001:

[source,clojure]
----
=> (require '[nrepl.server :refer [start-server stop-server]])
nil
=> (defonce server (start-server :bind "172.18.0.5" :port 4001))
='user/server
----

WARNING: Keep in mind that running a nREPL server on a public address
is an epic security hole! As the connections are insecure (no
authentication, no authorization) by default anyone can connect to
your app and modify its behaviour or run code on the remote host.

Depending on what the lifecycle of your application is, whether you want to be
able to easily restart the server, etc., you might want to put the value
`start-server` returns into an atom or somesuch.  Anyway, once your app is
running an nREPL server, you can connect to it from a tool like Leiningen or
Counterclockwise or REPL-y, or from another Clojure process, as shown
 <<usage/clients.adoc,here>>.

You can stop the server with `(stop-server server)`.

== Server options

Note that nREPL is not limited to its default messaging protocol, nor to its
default use of sockets.  nREPL provides a _transport_ abstraction for
implementing support for alternative protocols and connection methods.
Alternative transport implementations are available, and implementing your own
is not difficult; read more about transports <<design/transports.adoc,here>>.
